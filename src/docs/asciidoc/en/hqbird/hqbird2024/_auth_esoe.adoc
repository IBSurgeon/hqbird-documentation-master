[[_hqbird_auth_esoe]]
= Authentication plugin for Execute Statement On External

Firebird has a convenient mechanism of cross-database queries: Execute Statement On External (ESOE). For example, the typical ESOE can look like this:
[source,sql]
----

EXECUTE STATEMENT 'SELECT * FROM RDB$DATABASE'
ON EXTERNAL 'server:db1' AS USER 'MYUSER' PASSWORD 'mypassword'
----

As you can see, the statement contains username and password in the open form, which is not secure: for example, if ESOE is called from the stored procedure code, connected users can see the password.

The HQbird Enterprise includes an authentication plugin for ESOE allows to establish trusted relationships between Firebird servers and perform the authentication of ESOE without a password:
[source,sql]
----

EXECUTE STATEMENT 'SELECT * FROM RDB$DATABASE'
ON EXTERNAL 'server:db1' AS USER 'MYUSER';
----

Let's consider how to install and configure HQbird Authentication plugin for ESOE.

== Installation of authentication plugin for ESOE

=== Authentication plugin files



* Windows
+
** [path]_plugins\cluster.dll_
** [path]_clusterkeygen.exe_
* Linux
+
** [path]_plugins\libcluster.so_
** [path]_bin\ClusterKeygen_ # executable


.Please note!
[NOTE]
====
The plugin files are already included into HQbird Enterprise, so you don't need to copy them.
There are different files for 32 and 64 bit versions of Firebird.
====

=== Configuration

==== In firebird.conf

First of all, it is necessary to add plugin name (Cluster) to the [parameter]``AuthServer`` and [parameter]``AuthClient`` parameters in [path]_firebird.conf_ on all servers which will trust each other:

----

AuthServer = Srp, Legacy_Auth, Cluster
AuthClient = Srp, Srp256, Legacy_Auth, Cluster
----

==== Keyfile

Then, it is necessary to generate keyfile for the plugin.
This key should be placed to the all Firebird servers which should trust to each other.

In order to generate keyfile [path]_cluster.conf_ run the following command:

----

C:\HQbird\Firebird30>clusterkeygen.exe > cluster.conf
----



As a result, the key file [path]_cluster.conf_ will be generated.
It contains 2048 digits key, something like this:

image::9.1.png[]

Then, we need to copy the key file to the all Firebird servers with trusted relationships to the [path]_plugins_ folder.
Key, created on Windows, can be used on Linux, and vice versa.

.Please note!
[NOTE]
====
The keyfile name should be exactly [path]_cluster.conf_.
It should be located in [path]_plugins_ folder of Firebird.
====

==== Mapping

In order to use authentication plugin inside the particular database, it is necessary to create mapping between users of cluster plugin and regular Firebird users.

For example, if we run the following ESOE
[source,sql]
----

EXECUTE STATEMENT 'SELECT * FROM RDB$DATABASE'
ON EXTERNAL 'server:db1' AS USER 'MYUSER';
----
we need to map user MYUSER to the actual user in the destination database db1.
Let's assume we have a user MYUSER2 in the destination database, in this case we need to create the following command in the destination database db1:

----

SQL> CREATE MAPPING usr_mapping_cluster1 USING PLUGIN CLUSTER
CON> FROM USER MYUSER TO user MYUSER2;
SQL> commit;
----

As a result, the mapping `usr_mapping_cluster1` will be created in db1, to map user MYUSER to MYUSER2.

.Please note!
[NOTE]
====
The both users should exist, even if they have the same name.
Otherwise there will be the following error:

----
Execute statement error at attach:

335544472: Your user name and password are not defined. Ask your database
administrator to set up a Firebird login.
----
====

You can create as many mapping as you need.
Existing mapping can be found in the table RDB$AUTH_MAPPING with the following query:

----

 SQL> select rdb$map_name, rdb$map_from, rdb$map_to from RDB$AUTH_MAPPING
 CON> where RDB$MAP_PLUGIN ='CLUSTER';

 RDB$MAP_NAME               RDB$MAP_FROM             RDB$MAP_TO
 ============================================================================
 USR_MAPPING_CLUSTER1            MYUSER		MYUSER2
----

==== Global mappings

It is possible to create mapping between users for all databases on the server -- in this case the following command should be used:
[source,sql]
----

CREATE GLOBAL MAPPING global_usr_mapping_cluster1 USING PLUGIN CLUSTER
FROM USER MYUSER TO user MYUSER2;
----

In this case, mappings will be stored in security database, to see them use the following query:

----

 SQL> select SEC$MAP_NAME, SEC$MAP_USING, SEC$MAP_FROM, SEC$MAP_TO
 CON> from SEC$GLOBAL_AUTH_MAPPING  where SEC$MAP_PLUGIN ='CLUSTER';

 SEC$MAP_NAME    	         SEC$MAP_USING    SEC$MAP_FROM   SEC$MAP_TO
 =========================================================================
 GLOBAL_USR_MAPPING_CLUSTER1  P                MYUSER         MYUSER2
----

==== Role mappings

In order to map user to the role in the destination database, it is necessary to create 2 mappings:
[source,sql]
----

CREATE MAPPING USR_CLUSTER9 USING PLUGIN CLUSTER
FROM USER MUSER TO ROLE RDB$ADMIN;

CREATE MAPPING USR_CLUSTER_X USING PLUGIN CLUSTER
FROM ANY USER TO USER MYUSER;
----

=== How to test

The following query can be used to test the work of the authentication plugin for ESOE:
[source,sql]
----

execute block
returns (
    CUSER varchar(255),
    CCONNECT bigint,
    CROLE varchar(31))
as
begin
  execute statement
    'select CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_CONNECTION, CURRENT_ROLE FROM RDB$DATABASE'
  on external 'server:db1'
  into :CUSER, :CCONNECT, :CROLE;
  suspend;
end
----

As a result, this query will return username, connection id and user role from the destination database db1.
