== Monitoring with HQbird FBDataGuard

=== Overview

HQbird monitors all aspects of Firebird server and database functioning, and includes continuous monitoring and detailed monitoring.

The continuous monitoring is performed by HQbird FBDataGuard. It is low-invasive, but very effective monitoring which can help to find and resolve the majority of issues with databases performance and stability.

FBDataGuard performs the following monitoring activities:

* Optional performance monitoring with TraceAPI and MON$
* Monitoring of transactions markers dynamics (Next, OAT, OIT, OST, active transactions)
* Monitoring of lock table activity (queues, deadlocks, mutexes)
* Monitoring of Firebird log (errors, warnings, messages)
* Number of connected users
* Free space monitoring for server, databases and their backups
* Health monitoring through analysis of database metadata and general availability of server and databases
* Number and size of Firebird temporary files (sorting, etc)
* Indices monitoring: health and activity check
* General validation of Firebird database
* Backups statuses monitoring
* Replica availability monitoring

FBDataGuard can graphically represent information gathered during the monitoring, for example, transactions and number of users:

=== Automatic monitoring with FBDataGuard (Trace API and MON$)

In the version 2020, HQBird introduces the new approach for the automatic performance monitoring with Firebird MON$ tables and TraceAPI.

Now it is possible to schedule the regular check of database performance in less than 1 minute.

For this just open tab Performance and setup monitoring for transactions and queries:

image::4.1.3.png[]

In order to setup Performance monitoring, specify its mandatory parameters in the dialog:

image::4.1.4.png[]

The first mandatory parameter is "`*Enable performance monitoring*`" -- it must be enabled to run traces by schedule.

The next important parameters are "`Start trace session at`" and "`Stop trace session`".
They contain CRON expressions which specify when tracing starts and stops.

*By default, trace is set to start at 10-30 and to end at 11-00*. It is recommended to adopt tracing schedule for your needs. Below you can see the table with some popular options.

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
2+h| CRON expression for
.2+h| Description

h| Start
h| End

|0 0 * ? * *
|0 10 * ?* *
|Run trace every hour from 0 to 10 minutes

|0 0 8 ? * *
|0 0 17 ?* *
|Run trace every day from 8-00 to 17-00

|0 30 10,13,15 ? * *
|0 0 11,14,16 ? * *
|Run trace sessions every day from 10-30 to 11-00, 13-30 to 14-00 and from 15-30 to 16-00

|===

The next important parameter is time threshold for the slow queries, it is set in the field "`Log SQLs with execution time more than`". In this field you need to set time threshold (in milliseconds), after exceeding it logs will be stored and analyzed.

By default, the time is set to 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second. It means, that only queries which take more than 1 seconds, will be logged and analyzed.

We recommend keeping 1000 ms as a basic value, until your database is very slow: in this case 3000-5000 ms can be a good start.

"`Send email`" check mark indicates if there necessity to send the performance report.
The email settings from Alerts configuration will be used to send performance report.

For more advanced settings, "`Performance Monitoring`" dialog has additional parameters (normally, you don't need to adjust them).

image::4.1.5.png[]

* "`*Configuration template*`" -- name of the configuration template file which should be used for trace settings
* "`*Database filter*`" -- how the database should be identified. Usually "`AUTO`" is enough, it will trace specified database. In case of "`FILENAME`" or "`ALIAS`" it will use filename or alias to filter database events. "`MANUAL`" provides an ability to set any regular expression, to trace several databases, for example, or more than one alias for the single database.
* "`*Database name filter*`" it is used in case of "`MANUAL`" selection.
* "`*Keep recent reports*`" -- it specifies how many reports should be kept in the "`Output folder`" for possible retrospective usage.

As a result of this job, HQbird will generate the performance report, which will be stored in the Output folder as a file with the extension **html**, and it will be sent by email (in case if "`Send email`" is enabled). Also the most recent performance is available for review and download in the HQBird interface.

=== What can we see in the performance report?

The HQbird FBDataGuard performance analysis provides 3 types of reports:

. list of queries sorted by their time -- "`Sort by duration`";
. list of queries sorted by its frequency -- "`Sort by frequency`";
. list of queries sorted by the total time (i.e., summary execution time for queries with the same text and various parameters) -- "`Sort by summary`".

In the beginning of the report you will see the graphical representation of most problematic SQL queries:

image::4.1.7.png[]

image::4.1.7-1.png[]

When you click "`Sort by duration`" (it is a default option), you will see SQL queries and stored procedures which took the longest time to execute first.

Normally there will be long-running reports and other big SQLs.

image::4.1.8.png[]

When you click on "`Sort by frequency`" link in the header of the report, you will see most frequent queries: i.e., those queries which started frequently (among logged queries).

image::4.1.9.png[]

For example, in this case the statement `SP_GET_INVOICE_REPORT` was run 46 times. It means that this query heavily affects the overall performance, and it should be optimized first.

When you click on "`Sort by summary`", you will see the queries which took the most part of the time (among logged queries). These queries usually are the best candidates for the optimization.

image::4.1.10.png[]

==== Detailed information for the problematic SQL queries

To see details of the most frequent query, click in the link "`View details`" in the bottom of the query text:

image::4.1.11.png[]

As a result, you will see the longest query among the queries with the same SQL text, with its execution plan, execution statistics and input parameters.

This information is enough to analyze and optimize SQL query in Firebird SQL Studio or other developer IDE.

=== How to select a tool for detailed monitoring

FBDataGuard is the first line of a defense for Firebird database; once FBDataGuard encounters something suspicious inside the monitored areas, it sends an alert with description of the issue.

.Important!
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have several Firebird servers, we offer HQbird Control Center application which gathers alerts data from the Firebird servers and databases and shows them at the single screen. Contact our for more details.
====

After receiving such alert from FBDataGuard the database administrator should proceed with detailed investigation of the problem.

The choice of tool for detailed monitoring depends on the type of detected problem.

If FBDataGuard reports long-running active transaction (Next-OAT), it is necessary to use *HQbird Mon$Logger* to detect the source of currently running active transaction.

If stuck of oldest interesting transaction is reported, database administrator must plan an explicit sweep to clean uncollected garbage with FBDataGuard sweep job (if it is necessary) and then plan tracking of forced rollbacks with Performance Monitoring in FBDataGuard.

If users report slowness problem with some queries, it is necessary to configure Performance Monitoring and use Advanced Performance Monitoring.

The problems with general database performance and occasional or periodic slowness require an analysis of database structure, which can be done only with HQbird Database Analyst.

Below we will consider how to work with HQbird monitoring tools in more details.

<<<

== Monitoring with MON$ tables: HQbird MonLogger

HQbird MonLogger is a tool to analyze monitoring tables output in Firebird and find problems with slow SQL queries, wrongly designed transactions (long-running transactions, transactions with incorrect isolation level, etc) and identify problematic applications.

MonLogger can connect to Firebird database with performance problems and identify what is the reason of slowness: is it some user attachment, slow SQL query or long-running transaction?

MonLogger supports Firebird 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 -- for older Firebird versions or InterBase please use FBScanner (it is not included in HQbird, should be purchased separately).

MonLogger can show you:

* Top attachments with highest number of IO operations, non-indexed and indexed reads
* Top SQL statements with highest number of IO operations, non-indexed and indexed reads
* Problematic transactions: long-running transactions, transactions with erroneous isolation level, read/write transactions, and related information: when they started, what applications started these transactions, from what IP address, etc
* Attachments and statements with the most intensive garbage collection actions
* Read/write ratio, INSERTS/UPDATE/DELETE ratio, and more.

After connection to the database where you want to find performance problems, several snapshots of monitoring tables should be done -- click on "`Get Snapshot`" to take snapshot.

=== Aggregated performance statistics for users attachments

At the first screen we can see aggregated statistics for database connections, and identify connections with the biggest problems:

image::4.2.1.png[]

==== Sequential reads / Indexed reads

"`Sequential reads / Indexed reads`" shows us total ratio between sequential (non-indexed) reads and indexed reads in application. Usually number of non-indexed reads should be low, so big percent of sequential reads is sign that many SQL queries have `NATURAL` execution plans, and they could be a reason of slow response time.

Click on record in "`TOP attachments: sequential/indexed reads`" will bring you to tab "`Attachments`", where you can see more details about Attachment, and then jump to tab "`Transactions`" or "`Statements`", where you will see transactions and statements linked with selected attachment (if checkmark "`Link to selected attachment`" is on, otherwise all transactions/statements for all attachments will be shown).

==== Write details

"`Write details`" gives you an overview of write operations: ratio between INSERTs/UPDATEs/DELETEs among all database attachments. In the table of top writers you can see attachments with the biggest number of write operations. It is useful to identify applications or software modules which performs excessive number of update or deletes (which are the most dangerous operations in terms of garbage collections).

==== Garbage collection details

What garbage collection operations mean?

* Purge -- engine removes back-versions, only primary version is in database.
* Expunge -- both primary version and all back-versions were deleted.
* Back-out -- remove only primary version (due to rollback).

Usually we can associate purge with `UPDATE` operation, Expunge with `DELETE`, and Backout with rollback of `INSERT` or `UPDATE`. Many backouts could mean that there is a problem with transaction management in the application.

==== Memory usage

"`Memory usage`" graph shows us total memory used by all active attachments now, and peak of allocated memory for them in the past.

List of top attachments by memory usage shows us the biggest memory consumers among your attachments. It is useful to find applications or software modules with excessive memory usage.

=== Aggregated performance statistics for statements

At the second tab you can find aggregated performance statistics for statements.

image::4.2.2.png[]

This statistics better reflects the momentary situation in the database -- since monitoring tables collect information since the beginning of each object life, statements you can see here are those which were running during the moment when snapshot was taken.

==== Sequential reads / Indexed reads

In this list we can see top statements which perform many sequential reads from the database. Usually such statements require SQL tuning -- either through indices tuning, or through SQL query redesign.

To tune the query, check its execution plan: usually it is possible to improve query speed by eliminating `NATURAL` in plans with new indices or query redesign. Click on the statement in this list to open tab "`Statements`", where you can find more details about selected statement, and jump to associated transaction or attachment.

==== Page reads/page writes

This graphs and list shows brief information about top statements which perform many reads -- it means that they consume significant IO and can affect performance of other queries. SQL statements with peak values should be carefully checked for optimal performance.

==== Write details for statements

At this graph you can see what writing SQL statements were doing at the moment when snapshot of monitoring tables was taken, and identify UPDATES and DELETEs which made many changes in the database.

==== Garbage collection details for statements

At this graph we can see how many garbage collection operations were done by statements running at the moment of snapshot.

==== Memory usage for statements

Unlike aggregated memory usage statistics for attachment, statements' memory usage can show us list of exact statements which consume a lot of memory at the moment.

=== Attachments

The third tab is "`Attachments`". You can open this tab directly to jump there by clicking one of the records at "`Aggregated performance statistics`".

image::4.2.3.png[]

"`Attachments`" shows the list of users connected to the Firebird database, with many useful details: `USER` and `ROLE` of attachment, start time and ID of attachment, is there garbage collection enabled for the attachment, name of remote process which established an attachment, and several accumulated performance counters for the attachment: number of sequential reads (done by attachment since its start), number of indexed reads, number of inserts, updates and deletes, as well records backouts, purges and expunges.

By default, some of columns of attachment are switched off, to show only most important information.

Of course, every time you click on attachment, you can jump to transactions running inside it, and then to statements. There is a checkbox in the left upper corner of "`Transactions`" and "`Statements`" tabs, which controls the behavior -- when checked, only transactions and statements marked by selected attachment ID, will be shown.

=== Transactions

Tab "`Transactions`" shows active transactions at the moment when snapshot was taken.

image::4.2.4.png[]

If checkbox "`Link to selected attachment`" is enabled, only transactions for selected attachment will be shown, otherwise all transactions are shown.

One of the most important characteristics is a lifetime of transactions: since Firebird is designed to work with short write transactions, it is important to keep them as short as possible. MonLogger highlights transactions with isolation modes and read-write settings which hold Oldest Active transaction and therefore provoke excessive record versions to be not cleared. If you see such transaction and it started a while ago, it means that it can be responsible for excessive records versions.

Sort on "`started at`" column and look for old transactions, marked in red: all writeable transactions and read only snapshots stuck Oldest Active Transaction and provoke excessive record versions to be hold. Identify where these transactions started (right-click and select "`View parent attachment`") and fix your code to commit this transaction earlier.

=== Statements

image::4.2.5.png[]

Tab "`Statements`" shows statements active at the moment of snapshot: if you need to catch all statements, configure Performance Monitoring and use Advanced Performance Monitoring.

If "`Link to selected attachment`" is enabled, only statements for specific attachment will be shown, otherwise all active statements are in the list.

Some statements have no associated transaction id (=0): these queries are prepared, but not executed.
